**Real-Time Traffic Signal Prediction for Efficient Traffic Management in Smart Cities Using IoT**

**Abstract**

In modern smart cities, efficient traffic management is crucial for reducing congestion, improving road safety, and minimizing environmental pollution. Traditional traffic signal control systems rely on fixed timing schedules, which are inadequate for handling dynamic traffic conditions. This research proposes a real-time traffic signal prediction system that utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology and machine learning techniques to optimize traffic flow. By leveraging Raspberry Pi devices installed at each junction, video data is captured and processed using computer vision techniques, specifically YOLOv8n, to detect and classify various types of vehicles, including bicycles, buses, cars, motorcycles, pedestrians, and trucks. The detected traffic data is then used to train a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model for predicting future traffic patterns. The trained GRU model is capable of forecasting the number of vehicles of each class expected to arrive at the junction, enabling intelligent and adaptive traffic signal control. The proposed system aims to reduce traffic congestion, improve travel times, and enhance the overall efficiency of urban transportation networks. The real-time prediction capabilities of the system, combined with IoT-enabled data collection and intelligent signal control, offer a promising solution for effective traffic management in smart cities.

**1. Introduction**

The rapid urbanization and growing population in modern cities have led to increased traffic congestion, which poses significant challenges for transportation systems. Traffic congestion not only causes frustration for commuters but also contributes to environmental pollution, economic losses, and compromised road safety. Traditional traffic signal control systems, which rely on pre-determined timing schedules, are often inadequate in addressing dynamic traffic conditions and unexpected events. To address these challenges, smart cities are adopting innovative technologies and data-driven approaches to optimize traffic flow and improve overall transportation efficiency.

One promising solution is the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology with machine learning techniques for real-time traffic signal prediction and control. IoT devices, such as Raspberry Pi units, can be deployed at intersections to capture video data and perform computer vision-based vehicle detection and classification. This data can then be utilized to train machine learning models, specifically Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models, for predicting future traffic patterns and optimizing traffic signal timings accordingly.

The proposed system leverages the power of IoT and machine learning to enable intelligent and adaptive traffic signal control. By accurately predicting the number and types of vehicles approaching an intersection, the system can dynamically adjust the signal timings to minimize congestion and improve overall traffic flow. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of urban transportation networks but also contributes to reduced emissions and improved road safety by minimizing unnecessary idling and stop-and-go traffic patterns.

(Literature Review)
Previous research efforts in the field of traffic signal optimization have explored various techniques, including model-based approaches, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms [1-5]. However, these methods often rely on simplified traffic models or lack the ability to adapt to real-time traffic conditions effectively. The integration of IoT technology and computer vision techniques, as proposed in this research, offers a more comprehensive and adaptable solution by leveraging real-time data collection and intelligent signal prediction.

The use of computer vision techniques, such as YOLOv8n, for vehicle detection and classification has been widely studied and applied in various domains, including autonomous driving and traffic monitoring [6-8]. However, the application of these techniques in conjunction with IoT-enabled data collection and machine learning models for traffic signal prediction is a novel approach that has the potential to significantly improve traffic management in smart cities.

(Objectives and Scope)
The primary objectives of this research are:

1. Develop an IoT-based system for real-time traffic data collection at intersections using Raspberry Pi devices and computer vision techniques.
2. Implement a YOLOv8n model for accurate detection and classification of different vehicle types, including bicycles, buses, cars, motorcycles, pedestrians, and trucks.
3. Train a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model using the collected traffic data to predict future traffic patterns at intersections.
4. Integrate the traffic prediction model with an intelligent traffic signal control system to optimize signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions.
5. Evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of traffic flow efficiency, travel time reduction, and environmental impact.

The scope of this research encompasses the design, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed real-time traffic signal prediction system within the context of a smart city environment. The system will be deployed and tested in a selected urban area, with the aim of demonstrating its effectiveness in improving traffic management and contributing to the overall sustainability and livability of the city.
